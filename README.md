# repo-hygiene
Repo practices that maintain cleanliness, health, or optimal conditions.

This an App based solution, if GitHub Action are not an option.
The App should be triggered on a PR and check the Repo for hygiene policy compliance. 
If the Repo fails the compliance conditions, a check run failure will be set.
