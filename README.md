# repo-hygiene
Repo practices that maintain cleanliness, health, or optimal conditions.

> An App based solution, if GitHub Actions are not an option.

The App should be triggered on a PR and check the Repo for hygiene policy compliance. 
If the Repo fails the compliance conditions, a check run failure will be set.
